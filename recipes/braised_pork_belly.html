            This recipe is my own personal spin on one of Thomas Keller's favorite recipes: 
            braised and glazed short ribs. I put an Korean twist on it, adding gochujang to the 
            marinade. I also switched the short ribs out for pork belly, as I think it takes on the 
            gochujang flavor much better than beef (plus who doesn't love pork belly?).

            This recipe does definitely take a while, clocking in at three days of total time (though 
            actual cook time is only a few hours, and active time is only an hour or so). It's worth
            the wait though, so plan to start this on Friday and eat it for dinner on Sunday.

            The sweet and spicy flavors in the glaze complement each other incredibly well. For an added
            layer of depth, serve this with some homemade kimchi (store-bought works too; I won't tell anyone).
            Do be warned that this dish is very rich, so you'll want to eat a small amount of it with a 
            healthy portion of rice.

                <li>Place marinade and pork belly into a container and marinate overnight.</li>
                <li>The next day, slice the pork belly into 1-inch cubes and put into the Dutch oven
